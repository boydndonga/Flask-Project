# Flask-Project

STEP ONE
- Go through the code and understand how i have structured it and correct where i have gone wrong

- There are two users in the database kev and john we can use them while testing api
- I have created a folder for api with users directory and the endpoints we can create and test.

- With this project lets tackle all the back end / create all the api that a project can have.
- Lets create tables and join and see how the relationship works.


NOTE
- After you go through and fix the code better lets start with a simple API.
